Description: This package is built upon the functionalities of stringr and
    readr. It uses these to create further handy string and file processing
    and manipulation tools, such as a function to reverse a string, a function
    to extract the nth number from a string (where a "number" is a sequence of
    numeric charachters) and a function to move a specified set of files to a
    directory, creating that directory if it does not already exist.
